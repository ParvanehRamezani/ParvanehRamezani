<!--
hello everyone, since today we won’t have class,
if you finished the exercises from Tuesday here’s another one you can try:
1. Create 2 or more JavaScript objects representing products you can buy.
They could be clothing products, or simply vegetables or whatever you prefer
2. each product object will have 2 properties: a name, containing the product name and a price,
containing the price of the product
3. write a function that accepts 2 product objects as parameters.
4. the function will return the name of the most expensive product between the 2
5. test the function with different products
